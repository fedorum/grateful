# Grateful
Grateful is a program that encourages users to take a moment to reflect on the things in life they are grateful for.

Every time the program is run:
- The user may input something they are grateful for that day, to be recorded down as an entry
- It displays something the user had inputted previously
- The user may choose to amend entries, view all entries, or exit the program

To run the program, run the grateful.py file by typing in the terminal "python grateful.py".
